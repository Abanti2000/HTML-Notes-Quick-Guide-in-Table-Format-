    <article>I love coding. Or rather, what coding allows me to create. What started out in GWBasic in my childhood evolved into .NET, Node.JS, and Angular these days. Writing code is deeply engrossing, provided that I’m able to find the right solution to the problems I’m attempting to solve. There are also moments where coding is deeply frustrating. Most of those moments revolve around my inability to find an elegant solution to a problem. I can feel deeply frustrated by code that is far more complex than it should be, and I don’t know how to make it better.</article>
